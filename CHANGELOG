# CHANGELOG


## 0.2.1

* Gross output now has hypermutated columns on a seq by seq basis.
* Now creates reference sequence on instantiation. Can still be modified at run time by passing in different consensus_threshold
* Pulled out method for finding context at a given residue.


## 0.1.4

Switched out Sekhon 0.0.1 for >=0.1 (switched order of arguments to test function)


## 0.1.3

Haven't been keeping close track up till now...
