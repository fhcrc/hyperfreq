# CHANGELOG

## Version 1.0

### 1.2.0

* Now logging sequence name and mutation counts to warnings logfile to more easily evaluate quadrature convergence behaviour

### 1.1.0

* Addition of a maxiters option which allows you to specificy the maximum number of scipy iterations in the quadrature and optim packages used in betarat
* Requires a new version of betarat, and has clearer dependencies here


### 1.0.0

This major version bump sees the addition of many new features, and significant changes to the way we evaluate hypermutation. These features and changes include

* context based evaluation
* use of the beta ratio distribution for modelling the relative probability ratio of mutations in two contexts (switched out difference of betas for BetaRat distributions)
* more control over data output, and cleaner code base
* testing for multiple mutation patterns at once, and automatic pattern calling
* significant speed improvements achieved by deciding on hypermutation status using the CDF instead of a quantile (PPF), and computing of quantiles only if asked, and only for hypermutation positive sequences, unless otherwise specified
* analysis results are accessed through a generator instead of as attributes built up on the alignment object
* specification of call pattern statistic and prior from command line
* specification of multiple CDF and PPF (quantile) values for computation
* interactive mode


## Version 0

### 0.3.2

Now possible to specify mutation pattern from CLI

### 0.3.1

* Added ability to write out reference seqs
* When loading in reference seqs from a reference seqs file, seq is now stored as a Seq instead of SeqRecord for better underlying consistency

### 0.2.1

* Gross output now has hypermutated columns on a seq by seq basis.
* Now creates reference sequence on instantiation. Can still be modified at run time by passing in different consensus_threshold
* Pulled out method for finding context at a given residue.

### 0.1.4

Switched out Sekhon 0.0.1 for >=0.1 (switched order of arguments to test function)

### 0.1.3

Haven't been keeping close track up till now...
